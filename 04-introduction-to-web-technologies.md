## What is a URL?

A URL can be thought of as a path to a resource on a remote server, which is nothing more than a way to access data on someone else's computer. A "resource" maybe a web page, a media file, an entire site, a folder, or even a more complicated interactive experience. 

URLs have some similarities with paths, in that the forward slash character (`/`) is used as a path separator. Howeer, there is no guarantee that the structure of the URL corresponds directly to some filesystem hierarchy in the remote server.

There are also some additional elements to URLs that are important to attend to.

Just like with paths, there are absolute URLs and relative URLs. This distinction is not relevant for the rest of this lesson, but if you would like to learn more about this, please consult the [mdn web docs page, "What is a URL?"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_URL).
